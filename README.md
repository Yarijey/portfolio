# portfolio
Hello! 
Welcome to my portfolio 

This is a one page scrolling portfolio built with React

Portfolio file's organisation guide 

App.css in the src folder.
 
I am using a separate CSS file (App.css) because it helps keep my styles organized and makes my code cleaner compared to inline styling. It also allows me to leverage CSS's cascading nature and media queries for responsiveness.

React Components
Why?: Each section of your portfolio (Hero, About Me, Technologies, Projects, Contact) should be a separate component for better code organization and reusability.

How?: Create a new folder inside src called components. Inside components, create a new JS file for each section. For example, HeroSection.js, AboutSection.js, etc.
